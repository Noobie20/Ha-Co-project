# Haryana-Covid-project
My first project with python.
Simple application for visualisation of COVID19 on the districts of haryana. This generates a geographical visualization (choropleth map) upon the map of haryana and 
line charts for each district at any given day from 15 June up untill the present day.

I have not specified the source of the dataset because the data I access from is from a governmental database 
which I obtained through permissions and authorizations from the Government of Haryana with the help of my father who works for the Government of Haryana.
I have been allowed to use the data for personal uses only and not for publicizing it yet. 
Until then, I've added a video for my simple application in action.

**NOTE**
The Government stopped updating the database on 13th August, and consequently this application operates only upto 13th August.
